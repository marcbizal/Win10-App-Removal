A simple powershell script to remove useless Windows 10 built-in apps.

## Usage
All batch files must be run with administrative rights.

1. Run `Take Ownership of WindowsApps.bat`
2. Run `Remove Garbage Apps.bat`
3. Profit.

To restore Windows 10 built-in apps, just run `Restore Built-In Apps.bat`. This requires that you have already taken ownership of the `WindowsApps` folder.

*Enjoy!*
